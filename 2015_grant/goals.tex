\subsection{Project Goals}
\label{sec:goals}

This project has three specific goals:

\begin{enumerate}

%\item To use novel human experiments to accumulate and formalize the
%  properties and underlying processes of the human norm system---in
%  particular, the representation and activation of norms.

\item Developing computational formalisms required for representing
  social norms in artificial agents.

\item Showing that norms are learnable by artificial agents in our
  computational representation by developing and evaluating algorithms
  for norm learning in multi-agent settings.

\item Demonstrating a proof of concept by applying our norm
  representation and machine learning algorithms to collaborative
  tasks that involve both humans and machines.

\end{enumerate}
