\subsection{Some More Motivation}

\commenta{cut from AAAI paper}

Ultimately, a major goal for developing machine agents that act
intelligently in multi-agent scenarios is to apply them to real world
problems. Humans are already agents that machine agents interact with
in some current multi-agent environments (such as the stock
market and online advertising auctions). Successfully expanding the scope of applications where
multi-agent learning can be applied in the real world necessitates
studying how these agents interact with human agents. A machine agent
that interacts optimally against other machine agents, but not against
human agents, is not likely to be effective in environments that
include human agents. Further, one major goal of developing machine
agents is for them to solve tasks in collaboration with human
agents. Given the controversial nature of rationality assumptions for
human agents~\cite{kahnemanst82}, a machine agent that plans its
collaboration by assuming the human agent will act rationally
(optimally) is unlikely to be successful in collaborating with the
human agent.
